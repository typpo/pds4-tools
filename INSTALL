There are two options to install this package.

Option 1:

Use either PIP or easy_install, package managers which are included
with most Python distributions.

pip install PDS4_tools-xx.zip
easy_install PDS4_tools-xx.zip

Option 2:

Extract the PDS4_tools-xx.zip to any easily accessible location. After
launching Python, import the path as such:

>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.extend(['/path/to/your/extraction_directory'])

>>> from pds4_tools import pds4_read, pds4_viewer

The extraction_directory is the one that includes setup.py
On a windows machine use backslashes (/) instead of windows' normal
forward slashes to specify paths
